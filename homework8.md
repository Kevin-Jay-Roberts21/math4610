# Homework 3 

## Task 1 

For this Task I wrote code in python that will compute the kronecker product of two matrices. The routine can be found in
the file [here](https://github.com/Kevin-Jay-Roberts21/math4610/blob/master/linear_algebra_operations/linear_algebra_operations.py), 
and I ran the code in the main.py file under Homework 8 [here](https://github.com/Kevin-Jay-Roberts21/math4610/blob/master/main.py).

The inputs I used: 

```
A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
B = [[0, 5], [6, 7]]

print("The Kronecker Product of Matrix A and Matrix B is: \n" + str(kronecker_matrix_product(A, B)))
```

And the corresponding output: 

```
The Kronecker Product of Matrix A and Matrix B is: 
[0, 5, 0, 10]
[6, 7, 12, 14]
[0, 15, 0, 20]
[18, 21, 24, 28]
```

The code I wrote to perform this operation: 

```
