## Task 1 


## Task 2 


## Task 3 


## Task 4 


## Task 5 

For this task I have created all the linear algebra computations in python. Below I've provided links to the software manual
pages, where the code is used, and where the functions (all created in a single module), can be found.

#### vector addition
The software manual page can be found [here]()

The function can be found in this module [here]()

The usage of the function can be found under Homework 5, under Task 5 [here]()

#### vector vubtraction
#### scalar multiplication of a number and a vector
#### the length or norm of a vector
#### the dot product of two vectors
#### the cross-product of two vectors
#### the triple product of three vectors
#### the action of a matrix and a vector of appropriate length
#### the sum of two matrices
#### the difference of two matrices
#### the produce of two matrices of appropriate size
